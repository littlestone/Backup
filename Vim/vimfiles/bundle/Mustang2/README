this is a small edit of the Mustang Vim Colorscheme by hcalves. He deserves all the credit, find him and screenshots here: http://hcalves.deviantart.com/art/Mustang-Vim-Colorscheme-98974484 

My edits are basically only making the search highlighting look better.

Honestly this theme was love at first sight for me, you should try it too.
